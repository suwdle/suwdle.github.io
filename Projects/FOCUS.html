            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                FOCUS (Fall detection and Observation with Connected Urgency System) was developed to address the limitations of conventional fall detection technologies, which typically focus only on post-incident analysis. With an aging population, there is increasing demand for systems capable of detecting falls in real time and initiating emergency responses without user intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system combines multiple ROS2 nodes with a backend service and web dashboard, enabling real-time monitoring, voice interaction, and automatic emergency alerts. In particular, efforts were focused on integrating fall event detection with a user-accessible monitoring interface and automated SMS notification logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                I participated in this project as a project manager, contributing to planning, backend API implementation, and dashboard development.

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web-Based Monitoring Dashboard:</strong> A React-based interface visualizes camera feeds, node status, fall detection results, and user interactions. It communicates with ROS2 nodes via WebSocket for real-time data updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency SMS Notification:</strong> If a fall is detected and no user response is received, an alert message is automatically sent to a registered contact using the Solapi SMS API. The content of the message is dynamically composed by the LLM-based agent based on the situation and voice input.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall Detection Model:</strong> A GAT-based classifier processes keypoints extracted by YOLOv8-pose. Edge features (distance, angle, confidence) and PointOut augmentation are used to improve robustness.</li>
                <li><strong>ROS2 Modular Architecture:</strong> Individual nodes manage camera input, pose estimation, classification, speech processing, and data aggregation. Each runs independently to ensure parallel execution and fault isolation.</li>
                <li><strong>LLM Voice Agent:</strong> The system includes a voice agent that processes speech inputs and provides real-time information such as weather updates or news summaries. It is implemented using LangGraph and OpenAI API.</li>
                <li><strong>Alert Toggle with Redis:</strong> Users can enable or disable fall alerts through the dashboard, and the current status is stored in Redis and synchronized with all relevant services.</li>
            </ul>
