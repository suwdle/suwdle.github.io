                Robust fall detection is critical in safety-sensitive contexts such as elderly care. Recent fall detection methods leverage 2D human pose estimation, which encodes posture as compact skeletal keypoints. However, these systems are vulnerable to performance degradation when body parts are occluded or keypoints are missing. We propose a fall detection framework based on single-frame 2D pose estimation and a Skeleton-aware Graph Attention Network (StoneGAT). StoneGAT enhances GAT by incorporating edge features such as bone lengths, joint angles, and confidence metrics. We also introduce PointOut, a data augmentation strategy that masks keypoints during training to simulate occlusion and improve robustness. Experiments on a combined dataset of AI-hub and in-house samples show that StoneGAT with PointOut outperforms baseline models under severe occlusion.
